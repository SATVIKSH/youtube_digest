# Youtube Digest
A RESTful service designed to extract insightful data from YouTube videos.
With just a YouTube video link as input, this API delivers multiple capabilities to help users better understand video content and audience sentiment.
It is a powerful tool for content creators, marketers, and researchers looking to quickly gather actionable insights from YouTube videos and their engagement metrics.


## Key Features
### Video Content Blogging
The API analyzes the content of the video and generates a concise blog article summarizing its main points. This allows users to quickly grasp the video's topic without watching it in full.

### Comment Sentiment Analysis
The API also performs sentiment analysis on the comments section of the video. It categorizes comments into three types:
  - Positive: Comments expressing appreciation or favorable opinions about the video.
  - Negative: Comments that reflect criticism or dissatisfaction.
  - Neutral: Comments that neither praise nor criticize but offer objective observations or questions.

### Comment Summary
In addition to categorizing the comments, the API provides an aggregated summary of the overall sentiment, helping users understand the general perception of the video by its audience.
